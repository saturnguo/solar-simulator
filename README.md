<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

an astrophysical simulation of the earth's solar system. visualizes celestial bodies and their orbital mechanics in real-time. features include:
* real-time physics simulation:
    * calculates orbital mechanics between all celestial bodies utilizing Newtownian gravitational laws.
    * handled via custom c++ library for performance optimization.
* interactive visualization:
    * zoom in (+/=) and pan out (-) to explore the simulation!
    * add new planets by clicking on the window.
* dynamic starscape.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

ensure you have the following installed on your system: Python 3.8+, PyQt5

### Installation

1. install python dependencies.
   ```sh
   pip install PyQt5
   ```
2. clone the repo.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saturnguo/solar-simulator
   ```
3. execute the main script.
   ```sh
   python src/main.py
   ```

alternatively, skip the setup process by downloading the prebuilt .exe executable from the dist folder and running it directly. python dependencies still required.
